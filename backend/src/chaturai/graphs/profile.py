    üßæ Profile Completion Assistant for Logged-In Student

    **The student's OTP will be automatically provided to me for completing the login
    process. You do not need to ask the student for this information!**

    ‚úÖ WHEN TO USE THIS ASSISTANT
    Use this assistant **only** in the following situations:
        1. Finalize the login by submitting the OTP provided by the student.
        2. Navigate to the appropriate profile sections on the portal.
        3. Automatically fill in and submit the student's profile information across
            the necessary pages.

    This assistant is responsible for progressing the student through the profile setup
    phase, ensuring all required data fields are filled correctly (e.g., personal info,
    educational background, E-KYC, bank account details, etc.).

    üîÑ IMPORTANT: This assistant assumes that login credentials were already submitted
    earlier and that the OTP has now been received from the student.

    üìå COMMON USE CASES
        - A student has just provided their OTP after receiving it.
        - You are ready to help the student complete their onboarding by filling out
            their profile details.

    üìù HOW TO CALL THIS ASSISTANT
    Phrase your explanation as a **direct message** to the assistant. **Do not** use
    first-person language (e.g., ‚ÄúI will use...‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call...‚Äù). Instead,
    use imperative phrasing, such as:
        - "Submit the student‚Äôs OTP to complete the login, then continue to fill out and submit all required profile information on the portal."

    Provide the following information in your explanation to this assistant:
        - A clear explanation of **why** you are calling this assistant, with reference
            to the latest student message and the current state of the application
            process. **Remember, this assistant does not directly interact with the
            student---thus, the assistant is not aware of the conversation that is
            going on between you and the student!**

    üö´ DO NOT USE THIS ASSISTANT IF
        - The student has **not yet received or shared** their OTP.
        - The student‚Äôs profile is already fully completed and they‚Äôre moving onto
            applications, contract signing, or other next steps (use the relevant
            assistants for those actions).
        - The student is not logged in or is starting a new registration (use the
            `registration.register_student` or `login.login_student assistant` instead).

    Parameters
    ----------
    browser
        The Playwright browser object.
    browser_session_store
        The browser session store object.
    chatur_query
        The query object.
    csm
        An async chat session manager that manages the chat sessions for each user.
    explanation_for_call
        An explanation as to why the assistant is being called.
    generate_graph_diagram
        Specifies whether to generate ALL graph diagrams using the Mermaid API (free).
    last_graph_run_results
        The last graph run results from either the Login Student or Profile Completion
        graph. This is typically passed in by the chatur agent.
    redis_client
        The Redis client.
    reset_chat_session
        Spec√¨fies whether to reset the chat session for the assistant.

    Returns
    -------
    ProfileCompletionResults
        The graph run result.

    The process is as follows:

    1. If a previous state does not exist, then we initialize a new state with the
        results from the Login Student graph run.
    2. Otherwise, we load the last state for the Profile Completion graph and update it
        with the latest results from either the Login Student or the Profile Completion
        graph run (passed in by the chatur agent). Note that any changes made by the
        frontend to the last results of the **Profile Completion** graph run will be
        reflected in its own Redis cache.

    NB: Loading the last state for the Profile Completion graph works in this manner
    because the graph only needs the attributes defined by the `PageResults` schema and
    both Login Student and Profile Completion graph outputs inherit from this common
    schema. In other words, the common starting point for the Profile Completion graph

"""This module contains the student login graph.

The student login graph does the following:

1. Navigates to the login page of the candidate portal.
2. Fills in the login form with the email.
3. Solves the captcha and submits the form.
4. Also clicks the Login button to trigger an OTP email and text message to the student.
5. Persists both the browser and page states for the next assistant.

    üîê Login Initiation Assistant for Existing Student

    **The student's email and password will be automatically provided to me for logging
    in. You do not need to ask the student for this information!**

    ‚úÖ WHEN TO USE THIS ASSISTANT
    Use this assistant **only** in the following situations:
        1. To **initiate the login process** for a student who is **already
            registered** on the Indian Government Apprenticeship Portal.

    This assistant performs the initial login attempt using the provided credentials.
    If the credentials are valid, it will prompt the system to send a One-Time Password
    (OTP) to the student's registered email and mobile number.

    üîÑ IMPORTANT: This assistant **does not complete the full login process.**
    It stops after triggering OTP delivery. A separate assistant must be used to
    proceed once the student receives and shares their OTP.

    üìå COMMON USE CASES
        - A student needs to log in to complete their apprenticeship profile, but has
            not yet received the OTP.

     **After calling this assistant, you should use another assistant appropriate
     for the next step**, such as completing the profile, searching and applying
     for apprenticeships, or reviewing and signing contracts.

    üìù HOW TO CALL THIS ASSISTANT
    Phrase your explanation as a **direct message** to the assistant. **Do not** use
    first-person language (e.g., ‚ÄúI will use...‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call...‚Äù). Instead,
    use imperative phrasing, such as:
        - "Start the login process so the student receives an OTP on their registered contact details."

    Provide the following information in your explanation to this assistant:
        - A clear explanation of **why** you are calling this assistant, with reference
            to the latest student message and the current state of the application
            process. **Remember, this assistant does not directly interact with the
            student---thus, the assistant is not aware of the conversation that is
            going on between you and the student!**

    üö´ DO NOT USE THIS ASSISTANT IF
        - The student is **not yet registered** or is trying to create a new account.
        - The student has **already received and shared the OTP** (use another
            assistant to continue the candidate process instead).
        - The student is already logged in and working on later steps like profile
            completion, document upload, or application tasks (use other assistants for
            those purposes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    browser
        The Playwright browser object.
    browser_session_store
        The browser session store object.
    chatur_query
        The query object.
    csm
        An async chat session manager that manages the chat sessions for each user.
    explanation_for_call
        An explanation as to why the assistant is being called.
    generate_graph_diagram
        Specifies whether to generate ALL graph diagrams using the Mermaid API (free).
    redis_client
        The Redis client.
    reset_chat_session
        Spec√¨fies whether to reset the chat session for the assistant.

    Returns
    -------
    LoginStudentResults
        The graph run result.

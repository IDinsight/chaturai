"""This module contains the student login graph.

The student login graph does the following:

1. Navigate to the `Login as a candidate` page and auto-fill the required fields.
2. Solve the text-based CAPTCHA.
3. XXX
4. Submit the login form.
5. Return the graph run results containing (among other things) the persisted **page**
    state for the next assistant.

NB: This graph does **not** handle the entire Chatur process (e.g., E-KYC, bank account
setup, profile completion, etc.). It simply logs an existing student into the portal
and forwards the persisted page to the next assistant.

    üîç Login Existing Student Assistant

    **The student's email and password will be automatically provided to me for logging
    in. You do not need to ask the student for this information!**

    ‚úÖ WHEN TO USE THIS ASSISTANT
    Use this assistant **only** in the following situations:
        1. An **existing student** needs to log into the Indian government
            apprenticeship portal to continue with their application process. This is
            typically the case when the student has already completed the initial
            account registration and now wants to:
            - Fill out or update their apprenticeship profile,
            - Submit necessary documents, or
            - Apply for available apprenticeship opportunities.
        2. A student has previously started an application process but did **not
            complete** it, and now they want to resume their session by logging in.

     This assistant is used **only to facilitate a login for an already registered
     student**. It ensures that the student is authenticated on the portal so they can
     proceed to the next step in their apprenticeship journey. **After calling this
     assistant, you should use another assistant appropriate for the next step**, such
     as completing profile details, uploading documents, or searching and applying for
     apprenticeships.

    üìù HOW TO CALL THIS ASSISTANT
    Phrase your explanation as a **direct message** to the assistant. **Do not** use
    first-person language (e.g., ‚ÄúI will use...‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call...‚Äù). Instead,
    use imperative phrasing, such as:
        - "Log in the student so they can continue the application process."
        - "Authenticate the existing student to resume their application workflow."
        - "Initiate login for a registered student returning to complete their apprenticeship application."

    Provide the following information in your explanation to this assistant:
        - A clear explanation of **why** you are calling this assistant, with reference
            to the latest student message and the current state of th application
            process. **Remember, this assistant does not directly interact with the
            student---thus, the assistant is not aware of the conversation that is
            going on between you and the student!**

    üö´ DO NOT USE THIS ASSISTANT IF
        - The student is **not yet registered** or is asking to create a new account.
        - The student is already logged in and is trying to proceed with profile
            completion, document upload, or application steps (use other assistants for
            those actions).

    Parameters
    ----------
    chatur_query
        The query object.
    csm
        An async chat session manager that manages the chat sessions for each user.
    explanation_for_call
        An explanation as to why the assistant is being called.
    generate_graph_diagram
        Specifies whether to generate ALL graph diagrams using the Mermaid API (free).
    last_graph_run_results
        The last graph run results from either the Register Student graph. This is
        typically passed in by the Chatur agent.
    redis_client
        The Redis client.
    reset_chat_session
        Spec√¨fies whether to reset the chat session for the assistant.

    Returns
    -------
    LoginStudentResults
        The graph run result.

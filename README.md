## Overview

This project includes a data scraper for apprenticeship opportunities from the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) portal. It fetches opportunities daily and stores them in a database for further processing and recommendation purposes.

## Architecture

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **WhatsApp Connection**: Turn.io

## Known Issues/TODOs

1. Issues
   1. `pydantic-graph` has known issues with `mypy` at the moment. When running `make lint`, we can safely ignore type errors resulting from `pydantic-graph`/`pydantic-ai`.
2. TODOs
   1. All files under `cicd/deployment/docker-compose` needs to be checked again to ensure correct paths, etc.
   2. Notebooks in `examples/notebooks` needs to be updated.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy `cicd/deployment/docker-compose/.template.env` to `cicd/deployment/docker-compose/.env`.
2. Copy `cicd/deployment/litellm/.template.env` to `cicd/deployment/litellm/.env` and update:

   1. `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
3. Copy `backend/.template.env` to `backend/.env` and update:

   1. `FAST_API_KEY`: Your FastAPI API key (or just ask Suzing You for one).
   2. `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`: Your [Logfire write token](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/create-write-tokens/) (or just ask Tony Zhao for one).
   3. `LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN`: [OPTIONAL] Your [Logfire read token](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/query-api/#how-to-create-a-read-token) (or just ask Tony Zhao for one).
4. Copy the **root** `.template.env` to `.env` and update:

   1. `AWS_***`: Ask Suzin You for credentials.
   2. `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
   3. `PATHS_LOGS_DIR`: The absolute path to the logs directory for the project.
   4. `PATHS_PROJECT_DIR`: The absolute path to the root directory of the project.
   5. `PATHS_SECRETS_DIR`: Set this as `PATHS_PROJECT_DIR/secrets`and create the`secrets` directory.
5. Put `gcp_credentials.json` (copied as is from AAQ) and place it in `PATHS_PROJECT_DIR/secrets`

## Startup Instructions

1. Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html).
2. Install the latest version of Poetry using: `pipx inject poetry poetry-plugin-export`
3. Clone the repo and cd into the root directory of the repo. Allow `direnv` to load the environment variables by running `direnv allow`.
4. From the root directory, execute `make up`. This will start the backend services using Docker.
5. `cd backend`

   1. Allow `direnv` to load the environment variables by running `direnv allow`. This should allow `direnv` to load all environment variables for the backend.
   2. Execute `make fresh-env`. This will create a new virtual environment for the backend and install all dependencies.
   3. Execute `eval $(poetry env activate)`: This will activate the virtual environment created by `make fresh-env`.
   4. Execute `python src/chaturai/entries/main.py`: This will start the FastAPI server on `http://localhost:8000`.
6. Go to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to view the backend API routes.

   1. Try out the `chatur-flow` endpoint using the following parameters to simulate a student creating a new account:

      ```json
      {
        "type": "registration",
        "user_query": "i need help creating an account so that i can apply for apprenticeships.",
        "user_id": "1",
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "is_iti_student": false,
        "is_new_student": true,
        "mobile_number": "+919912515639",
        "roll_number": null
      }

      ```
   2. Then, use the following parameters to simulate logging a student into the apprenticeship portal:

      ```json
      {
        "type": "login",
        "user_query": "thanks, let's continue",
        "user_id": "1",
        "email": "user@example.com"
      }
      ```
7. When you are done, cd back to the root directory and execute `make down`. This will stop all backend services.

## Database Schema

The database consists of two main tables:

1. `opportunities`: Stores apprenticeship opportunities
2. `establishments`: Stores information about organizations offering apprenticeships
